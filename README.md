# nicholasmagi.it

Personal portfolio website — always work in progress.

## How to run the project
After having downloaded a copy of the project, open up a new terminal inside the folder `nicholasmagi.it/` and run 
```sh
npm run dev
```

### Front-End technologies
- **React** + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- Development server: **Vite**

The application does not need Back-End at the moment, but it will surely be implemented as soon as it gets reasonable and necessary. There's an API call inside the project — used to retreive information about my GitHub pinned repositories - which is implemented by **@berrysauce** (https://github.com/berrysauce/pinned). 

Nothing too fancy, but delivers a nice result.
